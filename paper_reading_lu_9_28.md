Overview: This paper reviews DL methods for recommendation. For example Autoencoders are used for feature extracting, dimensionality reduction, and producing predictions. RNNs are utilized to integrate historical views to obtain the evolution of users tastes coevolution between user and item (especially for session-based recommendation which integrates users's implicit behaviors to their preferences). CNNs are mainly used for extracting latent factors and features from data, especially from images and text.
